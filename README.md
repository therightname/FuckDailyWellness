3. Then tap the firefox icon 5 time rapidly! You have now enabled developer mode.
4. Under Menu Bar -> Settings you will see a title "Advanced". Under this category, Click "Custom Add-on Collection".
5. For "Collection owner" put 3753384, and for Collection name, type "NuxFavs". This is not controlled by me. Firefox Nightly should automatically restart. You have tampermonkey now on your Firefox Nightly under add-ons.
